subtitle: Speech & NLP Researcher

I am a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">Information Technology University</a>. Before that, I received an MS in Computer Science from the <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">Information Technology University</a> and a BS in Computer Science from the <a href="http://nu.edu.pk" target="_blank">National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences</a>.

<br />

I love computers, languages, and teaching computers to understand languages. In fact, there is an entire field for that called Natural Language Processing or NLP. To that end, I have worked on many interesting NLP and Machine Learning problems such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), Word Segmentation, Text Simplification, and hopefully more to come!
